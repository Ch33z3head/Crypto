### HowTo:
 1. This script  [Proj_2/Proj_2_Encrypt_Decrypt_Image_FINAL.py](https://github.com/Ch33z3head/Crypto/blob/main/Proj_2/Proj_2_Encrypt_Decrypt_Image_FINAL.py) will prompt you to enter one of three encytpion modes. -
 2. The image [Champs.png](https://github.com/Ch33z3head/Crypto/blob/main/Proj_2/Champs.png) that I used for this exercise has been provided.
