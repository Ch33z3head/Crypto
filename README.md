This repository contains the project deliverables to satisfy the assignment requirements for the Applied Cryptography class.

**Project 1** - Attempt to decrypt five cipher texts.  This is accomplished by performing analysis to determine the type of encryption algorithm that was used and then craft a python script to decrpyt the cipher text and generate the decrypted plain text.

**Project 2** - Craft a python script to encrypt and decrypt an image using the AES modes.

**Project 3** - Craft a script to simulate a ECDH key exchange incorporating deriving a shared key, send a message, encrypt the message using AES GCM mode, and pefomr RSA signing/verifying of the blocks of data to to ensure it message was not tampered with. That can happen with a
