_Write a suite of functions that allows you to encrypt and decrypt images using AES in any of the modes we studied.  Tweet out an encrypted image that someone else in class can decrypt.  Submit to me your code, an explanation of how I can use it, and a quick write-up:
 
What take-away lessons did you learn in this experience?
 
Which of your modes is good enough for nation-state security?
How would you rate your effort on this project?
  
How many hours were you able to give it?
__
HOWTO:
This script will prompt you to enter one of three encytpion modes.
The image that I used for this exercise has been provided.
The read and write pathes may need to be updated to suite your envivronment.
Once a mode has been entered two files will be generated, an encrypted and decrypted version of the orignal file.
