# Assignment 3 Write up - lliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman exchange

Final Project Tasks

For the final assignment I want you to build procedures that allow you to perform an:
* Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman exchange to establish a shared secret.  Use a NIST approved curve. (Module 5)
* For each chunk of public information sent generate an RSA Digital Signature. (Module 6)
* Validate the RSA digital signature of the packets you receive. (Module 6)
* Once you have a shared key encrypt a message using AES in GCM mode (not in our notes but not too different). (Module 3)
* If you can pull that off (even as both sides of the conversation) then you'll have done a full industry ready HTTPS packet encryption.
* Here is an online site you can use to validate your ECDH parameters:  http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/ecdh.htmlLinks to an external site.
Good luck!
